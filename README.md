Wrote complex SQL queries using CTEs, PARTITION, GROUP BY, date/time functions (DATENAME, DATEPART, MONTH, QUARTER, etc.), and aggregation functions to prepare the dataset.

Power BI Desktop:

Connected Power BI to SQL Server for real-time data refresh.

Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query (e.g., handling nulls, typecasting).

Built an optimized data model with appropriate relationships and hierarchies.

Developed custom DAX measures using functions like CALCULATE, SUMX, Time Intelligence, and filter expressions.

Designed user-friendly visuals using Cards, Bar & Line Charts, Donut Charts, and Slicers with intuitive formatting and navigation.

‚òÅÔ∏è Power BI Service (Cloud Deployment):
Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for web-based access and sharing.

Pinned critical KPIs to personalized dashboards for quick tracking and visibility.

Enabled scheduled data refreshes for up-to-date reporting.

Configured row-level security (RLS) to manage data access based on user roles.

Set up email subscriptions and alerts for proactive monitoring.
